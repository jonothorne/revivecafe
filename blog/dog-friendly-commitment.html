            </div>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>Walk into most cafes with your dog, and you'll get "the look." You know the one—the subtle scan to make sure you're not going to cause trouble. Maybe a reluctant nod toward the one table by the door where dogs are "allowed."</p>

                <p>At Revive Cafe in Norwich, we do things differently.</p>

                <h2>Everyone Means Everyone</h2>
                <p>When we say we're a <strong>dog-friendly cafe in Norwich</strong>, we don't just mean "we'll tolerate your dog if we have to." We mean your four-legged family members are genuinely welcome here—just as much as you are.</p>

                <p>Water bowls are always full. Treats are on hand (with your permission, of course). And that tail-wagging bundle of fur that makes you smile every day? They make us smile too.</p>

                <h2>It's About Community</h2>
                <p>Our mission at Revive Cafe, run by Alive Church, is to support the Norwich community. And guess what? The community includes dog owners, dog walkers, and everyone who believes that life's better with a pup by your side.</p>

                <p>Some of our best community connections have happened over conversations about dogs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The regular who walks her neighbor's elderly dog every morning and stops by for both their sakes</li>
                    <li>The local rescue volunteer who organizes informal dog meetups in our space</li>
                    <li>The family whose anxious rescue dog found our cafe to be a safe, calm space to build confidence</li>
                    <li>The Norwich dog walkers who've made us part of their route, bringing smiles (and wagging tails) every time</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                <p>Being dog-friendly isn't just nice—it's necessary. For many people, especially those living alone, dealing with mental health challenges, or facing social isolation, their dog isn't just a pet. They're family. They're companionship. They're often the reason someone gets out of the house at all.</p>

                <div class="blog-callout">
                    <p><em>"As someone with anxiety, knowing I can bring my dog to Revive Cafe means I actually go out. Other places make me feel like I'm imposing, but here, both of us are welcome. It's made a huge difference to my mental health."</em></p>
                    <p class="text-right">— Local Customer, Nelson Street</p>
                </div>

                <p>When cafes say "no dogs," they're not just turning away pets—they're often turning away the people who need community spaces most.</p>

                <h2>Our Dog-Friendly Promise</h2>
                <p>At our Nelson Street location in Norwich, here's what you can expect:</p>

                <h3>All Dogs Welcome</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Big dogs, small dogs, puppies, seniors—all welcome</li>
                    <li>No breed discrimination</li>
                    <li>Water bowls always available</li>
                    <li>Treats with your permission</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Comfortable Space</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plenty of room for dogs to settle</li>
                    <li>Easy-to-clean floors (accidents happen, we get it)</li>
                    <li>Calm atmosphere where dogs can relax</li>
                    <li>Staff who genuinely love meeting your pups</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Community Connection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A welcoming space for dog owners to connect</li>
                    <li>Part of the dog-walking route for many locals</li>
                    <li>Regular spot for informal dog meetups</li>
                    <li>Supporting Norwich's dog community</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>A Few Simple Guidelines</h2>
                <p>To keep things great for everyone (two-legged and four-legged), we just ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep your dog on a lead while inside</li>
                    <li>Clean up any accidents (we'll help!)</li>
                    <li>If your dog isn't comfortable around others, let us know—we'll find you a quieter spot</li>
                    <li>Be respectful of customers who may be nervous around dogs</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why We'll Always Be Dog-Friendly</h2>
                <p>Some businesses make policy decisions based on what's easiest. We make ours based on what's right.</p>

                <p>Norwich is full of dog lovers, dog walkers, and families who consider their pets part of the family. By being a <strong>genuinely welcoming dog-friendly cafe</strong>, we're not just serving coffee—we're creating a space where everyone belongs.</p>

                <p>And that aligns perfectly with our mission as a social enterprise. Community isn't just about humans. It's about making space for everyone who makes our neighborhood feel like home.</p>
